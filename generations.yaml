    description: "The Cadillac LYRIQ is the brand's first all-electric vehicle, built on GM's dedicated Ultium EV platform. The exterior design represents a new direction for Cadillac, featuring a distinctive black crystal grille with illuminated elements, ultra-thin vertical LED headlights and taillights, and a dramatic fastback-like profile with a steeply raked rear window. The initial launch configuration features a single rear-mounted electric motor producing 340 HP and 325 lb-ft of torque, with a dual-motor all-wheel drive version offering around 500 HP introduced later. Powered by a 102 kWh battery pack, the LYRIQ delivers an EPA-estimated range of 312 miles in rear-wheel drive form. Inside, the cabin showcases a minimalist luxury aesthetic dominated by a massive 33-inch curved LED display that combines the instrument cluster and infotainment system. Advanced technology includes Super Cruise hands-free driving capability, active noise cancellation, and a 19-speaker AKG audio system. Charging capabilities include up to 190 kW DC fast charging, allowing the addition of approximately 76 miles of range in 10 minutes. The LYRIQ represents Cadillac's shift toward electrification and serves as the vanguard for the brand's ambitious plan to transition to an all-electric lineup by 2030. As Cadillac's first purpose-built EV, it establishes a new design language and technological approach that will influence future electric models from the brand."
